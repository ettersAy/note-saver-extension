# Note Saver Extension - Refactoring Progress

## Overall Goal
To refactor the JavaScript codebase (primarily `popup.js` and its new modules) to improve its structure, reduce its length, enhance maintainability, and ensure adherence to coding best practices.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Establish Core Modules & Basic Structure
*   **Task 1: Create `src/domElements.js` Module**
    *   **Status:** Complete & Merged
    *   **Outcome:** Centralized all DOM element selections into `src/domElements.js`. `popup.js` now imports these.
*   **Task 2: Create `src/firebaseService.js` Module**
    *   **Status:** Complete & Merged
    *   **Outcome:** Encapsulated Firebase initialization and core Firestore/Auth operations (CRUD for notes, user auth, profile management) into `src/firebaseService.js`.
*   **Task 3: Create `src/uiManager.js` Module**
    *   **Status:** Complete & Merged
    *   **Outcome:** Consolidated UI update functions (`showStatus`, `renderTabs`, `loadNoteIntoEditor`, etc.) into `src/uiManager.js`.
*   **Task 4: Refactor `popup.js` (Main Orchestrator - Initial)**
    *   **Status:** Complete & Merged (Covered by the work in Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 5)
    *   **Outcome:** `popup.js` updated to import and use the new modules, becoming more of an orchestrator.

### Phase 2: State Management & Function Refinement
*   **Task 5: Centralize State Management in `src/stateManager.js`**
    *   **Status:** Complete & Merged
    *   **Outcome:** Application state variables (`notesCache`, `openTabs`, `activeTabId`, user details, etc.) moved into `src/stateManager.js` with getter and setter/modifier functions. `popup.js` now uses this module for all state operations.
*   **Task 6: Break Down Large Functions**
    *   **Status:** Complete & Merged
    *   **Outcome:** Focused on `updateAppUIForAuthState` in `src/uiManager.js`, breaking it down into smaller helper functions (`_setupUIForActiveUser`, `_setupUIForInactiveUser`, `_setupUIForLoggedOutState`) for improved clarity.

## Next Planned Tasks

### Phase 3: Code Clarity, Consistency & Specific Improvements
*   **Task 7: Constants for Magic Strings/Numbers**
    *   **Goal:** Improve maintainability and reduce errors by replacing hardcoded "magic" values with named constants.
    *   **Proposed Action:**
        1.  Create a `src/constants.js` module.
        2.  Identify magic strings (e.g., `'temp_id_'`, `'Untitled'`, Firestore collection names like `'notes'`, `'users'`) and any recurring numbers used for specific meanings.
        3.  Define these as exported constants in `src/constants.js`.
        4.  Refactor `popup.js`, `firebaseService.js`, `stateManager.js`, and `uiManager.js` to import and use these constants.
*   **Task 8: Review and Refine `autoSaveNote` Logic**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the debounced auto-save functionality is robust, clear, and correctly interacts with the `stateManager`.
    *   **Proposed Action:** Review the `autoSaveNote` function in `popup.js` and its interaction with `saveCurrentNote`, ensuring it correctly uses state getters (e.g., `getActiveTabId()`, `getCurrentUid()`, `isCurrentUserActive()`).
*   **Task 9: Refine `handleNewTab` and `temp_id_` Management**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the creation and management of temporary (unsaved) notes is clear and consistently uses `stateManager.generateTempId()`.
    *   **Proposed Action:** Review `handleNewTab` in `popup.js` and related logic to confirm `generateTempId()` is used correctly and the lifecycle of temporary tabs is well-managed.
*   **Task 10: Enhance Comments and Documentation**
    *   **Goal:** Improve overall code understanding and maintainability.
    *   **Proposed Action:** Add JSDoc comments to major functions and modules across the codebase (`popup.js`, `domElements.js`, `firebaseService.js`, `uiManager.js`, `stateManager.js`, `constants.js`), explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Clarify any complex logic sections.

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Final Polish (Future)
*   **Task 11: Standardize Error Handling and User Feedback**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure consistent, robust, and user-friendly error handling and reporting.
    *   **Proposed Action:** Review all `try...catch` blocks. Ensure errors from service modules are appropriately propagated or handled. Standardize messages shown to the user via `uiManager.showStatus`.
*   **Task 12: Code Style and Linting**
    *   **Goal:** Enforce a consistent code style across the project.
    *   **Proposed Action:** Consider setting up and running a linter (e.g., ESLint with a chosen configuration). Manually review for formatting consistency if a linter isn't immediately implemented.

## General Notes
*   The detailed Git and MCP workflow is documented in `REFACTORING_WORKFLOW.md`.
*   Each task will be implemented on a separate feature branch, a Pull Request will be created, tested by the User, and then merged by Cline upon User approval, following the established workflow.
